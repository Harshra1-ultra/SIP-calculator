Calculation Logic
The calculator uses the future value of an annuity due formula for SIP:

FV=P×( 
r
(1+r) 
n
 −1
​
 )×(1+r)

Where:

FV = Future Value (Maturity Amount)

P = Monthly Investment Amount

r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Return Rate / 100 / 12)

n = Total Number of Months (Investment Duration in Years × 12)

The total profit is then calculated as:
TotalProfit=FutureValue−TotalInvestedAmount
